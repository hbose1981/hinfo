Comparison of Chef Infra Client 16 vs 17 for RHEL 7, 8, and 9

Introduction

Chef Infra Client 17 (the first 17.x release in 2021) introduced significant updates and changes compared to the last 16.x release. This report highlights the differences relevant to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7, 8, and 9. We cover low-level code changes impacting RHEL systems, changes in features or behavior that could affect upgrades, deprecated functionality, new features/enhancements in Chef 17, and platform-specific considerations for RHEL 7, 8, and 9. The goal is to prepare a smooth upgrade from Chef 16 to 17 by understanding what’s new or changed.

Code-Level Changes Impacting RHEL (Chef 16 -> 17)

Several internal code improvements and modifications in Chef Infra Client 17 affect how it operates on RHEL-family systems:
	•	YUM/DNF Package Provider Improvements: Chef 17’s package providers for RPM-based systems were refactored for better reliability and performance. The yum_package and dnf_package resources now interact with the RPM database more efficiently, reducing run-time overhead when no changes are made ￼. For example, Chef 17 fixed a bug in yum_package when specifying a package version (which could misbehave in Chef 16) ￼. It also resolved edge cases with dnf_package – e.g. the :remove action no longer tries to remove the package manager itself if a target package is version-locked ￼. Chef 17 added full support for the allow_downgrade property in dnf_package (previously using this triggered a deprecation warning in Chef 16) ￼, ensuring parity with yum_package. Overall, these changes improve package management on RHEL 8/9 (which use DNF by default) and RHEL 7 (YUM backend).
	•	Ohai Platform Detection: The Ohai system profiler in Chef 17 gained updated logic for RHEL and its derivatives. Notably, Chef 17 recognizes new RHEL clones like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux as part of the rhel platform family ￼ ￼. (Chef 16’s later releases began adding this, e.g. Rocky Linux in 16.17 ￼, but Chef 17 continues with AlmaLinux etc.) This means on RHEL-derived distros, node['platform_family'] will correctly be rhel, ensuring cookbooks targeting RHEL work consistently on those systems.
	•	RHEL 8 Package Installation Quirk: Chef 17 RPM packages for RHEL 8 were adjusted to avoid dropping a build-ID file that could block installation of other Chef products. In Chef 16, installing Chef Infra Client could leave a build identifier in /usr/lib/.build-id that conflicted with Chef Server/Workstation installs. Chef 17’s packages no longer install that build ID file ￼, preventing such conflicts.
	•	RPM Installation Dependencies: The Chef 17 client installer on RPM-based systems now explicitly depends on coreutils. This change fixes an issue during Kickstart or minimal installations where Chef might install before coreutils, causing the creation of the /usr/bin/chef-client symlink to fail. By requiring coreutils, Chef 17 installation orders are correct ￼. (This addresses a subtle installation bug present in Chef 16 on minimal RHEL.)
	•	Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM): The rhsm_register resource (for Red Hat subscription/entitlement) was enhanced in Chef 17 with new properties like server_url, base_url, service_level, and release to better control how a node registers to Red Hat Satellite/Subscription Manager ￼. These were not available in Chef 16. Additionally, Chef 17 ensures that after registering, it flushes the Yum/DNF cache so that newly subscribed repositories are immediately usable ￼. This avoids the manual cache refresh that might have been needed in Chef 16.
	•	Systemd Service Handling: RHEL 7+ all use systemd, and Chef 17 contains fixes improving interactions with systemd. For example, a regression in Chef 17.0 that caused systemd_unit resources to re-enable/restart units on every run was fixed in subsequent updates ￼. Also, Chef 17’s service resource correctly loads service state on systemd hosts (addressing an idempotency issue) ￼. Performance was improved by reducing redundant shell-outs in systemd_unit actions ￼. These low-level changes mean more stable and efficient management of systemd services/units on RHEL 7/8/9 compared to Chef 16.
	•	Support Policy for Older RHEL: Chef Infra 17 dropped support for some legacy platforms. Importantly, 32-bit RHEL/CentOS 6 packages are no longer produced ￼. (RHEL 6 itself was EOL in Nov 2020.) Chef 17 continued to support 64-bit RHEL 6 through its lifecycle, but 32-bit was removed. While this doesn’t affect RHEL 7/8/9 directly, it signals Chef 17’s focus on modern RHEL versions only. RHEL 7 (and newer) are fully supported; note that RHEL 7 is 64-bit only for Chef 17 because 32-bit architecture support in general was being phased out.
	•	Miscellaneous Fixes: Many bug fixes in Chef 17 benefit RHEL users. For example, Chef 17 corrected an archive_file resource issue on CentOS 7 where archives couldn’t be found ￼, and it resolved non-zero exit code errors from underlying Yum/DNF helper scripts that could appear in system logs ￼. These code-level fixes eliminate edge-case errors one might have encountered with Chef 16 on RHEL systems.

Overall, Chef 17’s under-the-hood changes provide better platform detection, more robust package management (critical for RHEL’s yum/dnf), and refined service control – all of which improve the experience on RHEL 7, 8, and 9.

Feature and Behavioral Changes Affecting Upgrades

Chef Infra Client 17 introduced new functionality and some conceptual changes that may impact how you use Chef on RHEL nodes. These changes could potentially “break” existing workflows or require adjustments when upgrading from 16 to 17:
	•	Embedded Ruby Upgrade (2.7 to 3.0): Chef 17 ships with Ruby 3.0 as its embedded runtime ￼, whereas Chef 16 used Ruby 2.7. This is a major language upgrade. Most Chef cookbooks will not need changes, but any custom Ruby code (e.g. in libraries or custom resources) should be reviewed for Ruby 3 compatibility. Notably, Ruby 3 introduced changes in how keyword arguments are handled, which could affect custom methods. Performance generally improves under Ruby 3, but be aware that any Ruby plugins, gems or monkey-patches used with Chef may need updates to support Ruby 3.0 ￼.
	•	Knife Removed from Chef Client Package: In Chef 16 and earlier, the Chef Infra Client package included the knife command-line tool. In Chef 17, knife is no longer bundled with the client installation – it has been moved exclusively to Chef Workstation ￼. This change was made for security and footprint reasons (removing management capabilities from the agent). Practically, after upgrading to Chef 17, if you try to run knife on a node, you’ll find it missing. The solution is to use Chef Workstation for any knife operations or install the separate knife gem if absolutely needed. This separation means a smaller and faster Chef Client, but it requires operational adjustment: do not rely on Chef client installations for knife commands going forward ￼.
	•	Compliance Phase (Chef Automate Integration): Chef 17 introduces a built-in Compliance Phase that runs after the converge phase, integrating Chef InSpec scans natively into the Chef Client run ￼. In Chef 16, compliance scanning was typically done via the external audit cookbook. Upon upgrading, you have the option to enable the new Compliance Phase and remove the old audit cookbook. The Compliance Phase uses attributes under node['audit'] (the same as the audit cookbook) and can send results to Chef Automate. It’s off by default for compatibility (can be opted-in by setting node['audit']['compliance_phase'] = true ￼ ￼). While this feature doesn’t break anything on its own (since it’s opt-in in Chef 17), it represents a conceptual shift. Over time, the audit cookbook will be deprecated in favor of this built-in phase. When enabling it, ensure that any compliance profiles and attributes are configured as expected. Also note the new cli reporter for compliance phase that mimics live InSpec CLI output ￼. Upgrading users should plan to migrate to Compliance Phase for a more seamless and officially supported audit mechanism.
	•	Chef Client Scheduling vs Service Mode: Chef 17 signals a move away from running chef-client as a daemon/service in some cases. On Windows, running Chef as a service was outright removed due to reliability issues (Chef 17 no longer supports installing as a Windows service) ￼. On Linux/RHEL, the traditional approach was either a cron job or a systemd service (often managed via the chef-client cookbook). With Chef 17, new built-in resources (described later) encourage using native schedulers (cron or systemd timer) instead of a long-running service. While you can still use a systemd service on RHEL for continuous Chef runs, the recommended approach in Chef 17+ is to use chef_client_cron or chef_client_systemd_timer resources to schedule runs at intervals ￼ ￼. This improves reliability (no more hung daemon processes) and allows flexible scheduling (e.g. no runs on battery power, run immediately after boot, etc.). If your RHEL nodes were using the old chef-client init service from Chef 16, consider migrating to the new scheduled-run method during the upgrade. (The chef-client cookbook’s service recipe is effectively superseded by these resources.)
	•	Unified Mode for Custom Resources: Chef 16 introduced Unified Mode for custom resources (opting out of separate compile/converge phases). In Chef 17, this doesn’t break recipes, but it will emit warnings for custom resources that do not explicitly enable unified mode ￼. This is a forward-looking change: Chef 18 intends to make unified mode the default for all custom resources. So upon upgrading to 17, your Chef run logs may show deprecation warnings about resources missing unified_mode true. It’s advisable to begin updating your custom resources to include unified_mode true in their DSL ￼. This ensures they continue to work in Chef 18 and quiets the warnings in Chef 17. While not an immediate breaking change, it’s an important behavior change that maintainers should act on during the upgrade cycle to avoid future issues.
	•	Configuration and Terminology Changes: Chef Infra 17 deprecates some old terminology in configuration. Specifically, the “whitelist attributes” setting (in client.rb or in audit data) is deprecated in favor of “allowlist attributes.” If you had whitelist_attributes configured in Chef 16 (to filter node data sent to Chef Server), Chef 17 will log a deprecation warning – you should update the config to use allowlist terminology ￼. This is a non-breaking change (only a warning), but important for compliance with new Chef terminology. Additionally, an older Chef Server 11-era mode for policyfiles (the policy_document_native_api setting set to false) is now formally deprecated in Chef 17 ￼. Environments using Chef Server 11 compatibility for policyfiles need to upgrade their Chef Server and enable the native policyfile API (Chef Server 12+). In practice, most users on Chef 16 likely already use modern policyfile support, but it’s worth checking that policy_document_native_api is not set to false in your configs when moving to Chef 17.
	•	Removed Support for EOL Platforms: Aside from RHEL6 32-bit mentioned earlier, Chef 17 also removed support for some outdated OS versions (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 2012, etc. ￼). In the RHEL context, the key change was dropping RHEL/CentOS 6 (except x86_64) as noted. Ensure none of your target nodes are running an OS outside Chef 17’s support matrix. RHEL 7 and 8 are fully supported. RHEL 9 was not yet generally available when Chef 17.0 released, so initial Chef 17 versions did not include official RHEL 9 packages. (Progress Chef later provided RHEL 9 support in Chef 18; see below for RHEL 9 specifics.)

In summary, upgrading to Chef 17 brings a few behavioral changes: you’ll need to use Chef Workstation for knife, consider enabling the new compliance phase, adjust any custom resources for unified mode, and update deprecated config terms. These changes are meant to improve security, performance, and future compatibility, but they do require awareness during the transition from Chef 16.

Deprecated Resources and Syntax in Chef 17 (Compared to 16)

Chef Infra Client 17 deprecates or removes certain functionality that existed in Chef 16. Users should identify these and adjust accordingly:
	•	Audit Cookbook (Legacy Compliance) – While not an official “deprecation” flag, the introduction of the Compliance Phase in Chef 17 effectively replaces the old audit cookbook. Continuing to use the audit cookbook is not recommended; instead, migrate to the built-in compliance phase ￼. The audit cookbook itself may still function in 17 (especially if you don’t enable compliance_phase), but it’s slated for obsolescence.
	•	Policyfile Compatibility Mode – The mode that allowed policyfiles to work with very old Chef Infra Server versions (v11) is deprecated in Chef 17. This was controlled by policy_document_native_api in the client config. Chef 17 expects users to be on Chef Server 12+ which natively supports policyfiles. If your client.rb has policy_document_native_api false, you should remove it or set it true, and ensure your Chef Server is up-to-date ￼. This compatibility shim will be removed in a future release.
	•	Whitelist/Blacklist Attributes – As mentioned, Chef 17 deprecates the terms “whitelist” and “blacklist” in favor of “allowlist” and “denylist.” In client.rb, ohai.optional_plugins, and audit configs, any use of whitelist_attributes should be changed to allowlist_attributes ￼. The old terms will still work throughout 17.x but will be removed in later versions (Chef 18+), so update them to avoid warnings and future breakage.
	•	Chef-Client as Windows Service – The ability to run chef-client as a service on Windows was removed in Chef 17 ￼. Instead, Windows nodes should use the chef_client_scheduled_task resource (introduced in Chef 16) for scheduled runs ￼. This primarily impacts Windows, not RHEL, but is notable if your environment has mixed OS. (On RHEL, you can still use a service/timer as appropriate; no direct removal happened for Linux services.)
	•	Ruby 1.x Support in gem Resource – The gem package resource (for installing system Ruby gems) now assumes at least Ruby 1.9+. This is only relevant if you were using Chef’s gem resource on extremely old systems with Ruby 1.8. Since all RHEL 7+ have newer Ruby or use Chef’s embedded Ruby, this deprecation is low impact (primarily cleaning up legacy support) ￼.
	•	Ohai filesystem2 Data – Chef 17 finished a long-running deprecation in Ohai data. On non-Linux platforms (AIX, Solaris, etc.), the legacy node['filesystem2'] attribute was removed ￼ (those platforms should use node['filesystem']). On Linux, this change was already applied in earlier Chef 16, so RHEL users likely won’t see a difference. It’s mentioned for completeness that Chef 17 purged some old duplicate Ohai data schemas.
	•	Knife Bootstrap Options – Chef 17 improved knife bootstrap (now typically run from Workstation) but also deprecated some older bootstrap usage. For example, knife bootstrap now supports using su on systems without sudo (with new --su-user option), and the older methods might be phased out ￼. Ensure your bootstrap processes use the up-to-date syntax.

To summarize the deprecations: most are configurations or scenarios that were already discouraged in Chef 16. During or after upgrading to Chef 17, check for deprecation warnings in chef-client output. Chef 17 issues warnings for things like missing unified_mode, old config keywords, etc., to give you time to update before they become errors in Chef 18.

New Features and Enhancements in Chef 17

Chef Infra Client 17 introduced numerous new features, resources, and platform support improvements. Key additions relevant to users (especially on RHEL) include:
	•	Compliance Phase Integration: As described earlier, Chef 17 adds a built-in Compliance Phase that runs InSpec profiles after the converge phase ￼. This feature lets you automatically audit node compliance in the same Chef run, with results viewable in Chef Automate. It eliminates the need for a separate audit cookbook and ensures you always have the latest compliance scanning capabilities out-of-the-box. New reporter options (like cli reporter for console output) were added to enhance visibility of compliance results ￼. This feature is a major highlight of Chef 17 for security and compliance use cases.
	•	Updated Platform Support: Chef 17 broadened OS support relative to early Chef 16. While Chef 16.x began adding support for RHEL 8, Chef 17 fully supports RHEL 8 and continued support for RHEL 7. RHEL 9 support was emerging during the Chef 17 lifecycle – official packages for RHEL 9 were not provided in initial 17.0, but later in the 17.x series there were internal updates (like dependency bumps for RHEL9 compatibility ￼). Official support for RHEL 9 (and Rocky 9) was finalized in Chef Infra 18, so for RHEL 9 you should plan on using Chef 18+. However, Chef 17 does recognize RHEL 9 clones in ohai and could be made to work if absolutely necessary (via community builds). In addition, Chef 17 added recognition for community RHEL derivatives: AlmaLinux was mapped to the rhel family ￼, and other clones like Amazon Linux 2023 are supported (Chef 17 supports Amazon Linux 2 and the newer AL2023 as a separate platform ￼). This expanded platform support ensures Chef can run on the latest Linux distributions that emerged around that time.
	•	Performance and Efficiency Gains: Many enhancements in Chef 17 improve performance. The refactored package providers (YUM/DNF) greatly speed up no-op runs on RHEL by avoiding heavy RPM database calls when not needed ￼. Chef 17’s client is also smaller and faster due to trimming dependencies ￼. The removal of knife from the client installation reduced the installation size and attack surface. Additionally, internal optimizations (like in chef_gem resource ￼ and systemd_unit as noted) mean Chef 17 runs can complete faster and with less memory/CPU usage, benefiting large-scale operations.
	•	Embedded Component Updates: Chef 17 updated many bundled components, bringing new capabilities:
	•	Chef InSpec 4.x – Chef 17 initially shipped with a late 4.x InSpec and later in 17.x possibly InSpec 5.x ￼. This provides improved scanning, new resources (for example, InSpec 4.50+ added a selinux resource for auditing SELinux modules and booleans ￼). Using the Compliance Phase in Chef 17 means you get these InSpec enhancements by default.
	•	Ohai 17 – Ohai was updated to gather more data (e.g., improved VMware detection with new vmware_* helpers ￼) and to handle new OS versions. For RHEL, ohai 17’s detection of AlmaLinux/Rocky is the notable update.
	•	OpenSSL and Libraries – Chef 17’s omnibus packages updated OpenSSL and other libraries to remain secure and compatible. For instance, OpenSSL 1.1.1 and later CA certificate bundles were included (Chef 16.17 had updated cacerts in late 2021 ￼, and Chef 17 continued this). This means improved security when Chef performs HTTPS requests (e.g., cookbook downloads, API calls).
	•	New Built-in Resources: A major benefit of Chef Infra Client 17 is the inclusion of many resources that were previously available only via community cookbooks. These new built-in resources simplify managing RHEL/Linux configurations:
	•	alternatives Resource: Allows managing the Linux alternatives system (the mechanism for switching default commands, e.g., selecting the default java version) directly via Chef. This was added in Chef 17, replacing the need for the alternatives cookbook ￼. On RHEL, this is very useful for managing tools like Java, Python, or editor alternatives.
	•	Chef Client Scheduling Resources: As discussed, Chef 17 added chef_client_cron and chef_client_systemd_timer for Linux, and improved the existing chef_client_scheduled_task for Windows ￼ ￼. On RHEL 7/8/9, you can now use:
	•	chef_client_cron: schedules Chef runs via cron (for systems where cron is preferred or where systemd is not available, e.g. some Unix or if you want the simplicity of cron) ￼.
	•	chef_client_systemd_timer: sets up a systemd timer unit to run Chef at a specified interval on any systemd-based Linux (RHEL 7+, Ubuntu 16+, etc.) ￼. This leverages systemd’s timer facilities instead of a persistent service. Chef 17 providing this out-of-the-box means you don’t need the external chef-client cookbook to configure it. Both resources are configurable (e.g. you can set the interval, random delay, CPU quota, and even a custom service_umask for the Chef run process ￼).
	•	user_ulimit Resource: Another Linux-focused addition, this resource lets you manage user ULIMIT settings (file descriptors, process limits, etc.) via Chef ￼. On RHEL, where you might previously use the ulimit community cookbook to edit /etc/security/limits.conf, now it’s a core resource.
	•	archive_file Resource: (Introduced in Chef 15/16 timeframe and improved in 17) This resource handles extracting archives (tar, zip, etc.) in a cross-platform way. By Chef 17 it was stable and resolved path issues on Linux as noted earlier. It’s a useful built-in for RHEL when packaging up code or configs.
	•	Miscellaneous New Resources: Chef 17 also added resources like plist (for macOS), and Windows-specific ones (windows_security_policy, windows_user_privilege, etc. ￼) – not directly relevant to RHEL, but indicative of Chef 17’s expanded capabilities on all platforms.
	•	Enhanced Resource Capabilities: Many existing resources got new features in 17:
	•	The service resource gained better detection of enabled/disabled state on systemd.
	•	The mount resource was updated for proper idempotency with loopback devices on Linux ￼.
	•	The rhsm_register resource, in addition to new props, now automatically clears Yum/DNF caches post-registration (so the very next package install can see the new repos) ￼.
	•	dnf_package was made smarter about package version comparisons (for example, handling package epoch and complex version strings correctly) ￼, ensuring idempotent upgrades even with modules/AppStreams.
	•	chef_client_config resource can now create needed config directories on the fly ￼, which helps when deploying client settings on fresh systems.
	•	Target Mode (Remote Execution): Target Mode was an experimental feature around this time (it allows running chef-client --target <host> to apply recipes to remote nodes over SSH/WinRM without needing a Chef Infra Client on the target). If your use-case includes managing devices or VMs without installing Chef client, you might explore this. Chef 17 documentation started to cover using Chef in target mode, although the feature matured in Chef 18. (This is a niche advanced feature, but worth noting as a new capability emerging in the Chef 17 era.)

In essence, Chef Infra Client 17 is a big leap in functionality: it incorporates what used to require numerous cookbooks or custom scripts directly into the Chef client. From a RHEL perspective, the new scheduling resources and alternatives/ulimit management are especially helpful. These features reduce external dependencies and simplify your Chef recipes after upgrading to 17.

RHEL 7 vs 8 vs 9: Platform-Specific Considerations

When upgrading Chef across RHEL 7, 8, and 9 systems, be mindful of the differences among these OS versions and how Chef 17 interacts with each. The table below summarizes key distinctions and impacts:

Aspect	RHEL 7 (Chef 17 on RHEL7)	RHEL 8 (Chef 17 on RHEL8)	RHEL 9 (Chef 17 on RHEL9)
Package Manager	YUM (YUM v3, Python 2 based). DNF not present by default. Chef uses the yum provider on RHEL7.	DNF (YUM v4). RHEL 8’s default package manager is DNF (alias yum). Chef automatically uses the dnf_package provider for package resources on RHEL8.	DNF (YUM v4). RHEL 9 uses DNF exclusively ￼. Chef 17 will use dnf_package for RHEL9 as well. (For compatibility, a yum symlink exists in RHEL9, but under the hood it’s DNF ￼.)
Systemd & Service Management	Systemd v219 is used (older version) ￼. All services are managed via systemd on RHEL7 (no Upstart). Chef’s service and systemd_unit resources fully support this. Chef 17’s chef_client_systemd_timer is supported on RHEL7 (which has systemd timers).	Systemd v239 (in RHEL 8.x). Service management is via systemd (no SysV). Chef behaves the same, with some improvements in 17.x for performance when managing systemd units. Using chef_client_systemd_timer on RHEL8 is recommended for scheduling chef runs.	Systemd v249 (or higher) ￼. Service management is systemd (with even more features). Chef 17 works with systemd on RHEL9 similarly. All Chef systemd-related improvements carry over. Systemd v249 on RHEL9 is newer, but Chef’s abstractions (service, systemd_unit) continue to work without issue.
Python/Ruby Dependencies	Python 2.7 is included in RHEL7 (used by Yum). Chef does not depend on system Python; it shells out to /usr/bin/yum. As long as Yum is present, Chef works. RHEL7’s system Ruby (2.0) is outdated but irrelevant since Chef uses embedded Ruby3. No direct Python/Ruby conflicts – just ensure Python 2 (for Yum) isn’t removed from a minimal install.	Python 3.x is used by DNF on RHEL8. The dnf command is available by default. Chef calls dnf CLI, so as long as the OS has DNF, Chef is fine. (On minimal installs, DNF will be present as it’s the package manager.) Chef’s embedded Ruby 3.0 runs on RHEL8 fine. RHEL8’s system Ruby (2.5) is not used by Chef.	Python 3.x is the default on RHEL9 and required for its package management. Chef uses the DNF CLI which leverages system Python 3, so that must be intact (it is, unless a user manually removes DNF or Python which would break package management generally). Chef’s embedded Ruby 3.0 handles its own Ruby needs. RHEL9’s system Ruby (3.0) might be available but Chef doesn’t need it. No special dependency considerations beyond ensuring you use the appropriate Chef package build for RHEL9 (if available).
Chef Client Package Availability	Official Chef 17 packages are available for RHEL7 (x86_64, and even other architectures like ppc64le as supported) ￼. RHEL7 is fully supported through Chef 17’s life.	Official Chef 17 packages are available for RHEL8 (all supported arches) ￼. RHEL8 was a primary platform during Chef 17 development, so it’s well-tested.	Limited Support: Chef 17 did not initially ship official RHEL9 packages (since RHEL9 came out around the time Chef 18 was released). As of early 2023, the Chef download page had no RHEL9 client package ￼. Running Chef 17 on RHEL9 might require using the closest equivalent (Rocky 9 package or source build). For full support on RHEL 9, upgrading to Chef Infra Client 18+ is recommended (Chef 18 added RHEL 9/Alma9/Rocky9 in its support matrix).
Notable OS Differences	Older kernel (3.10) and libraries on RHEL7, but Chef 17’s omnibus build ensures compatibility. One consideration: RHEL7 is in maintenance phase (EOL in 2024) ￼, so plan upgrades accordingly during Chef 17’s support cycle.	RHEL8 introduced AppStreams (multiple versions of components) and other changes. Chef 17 handles these (e.g., the DNF provider and module streams). Ensure any cookbooks account for module streams if needed (Chef can install modules via dnf). RHEL8 is in full support and Chef 17 fully supports it.	RHEL9 is a new major OS with kernel 5.x and many updated subsystems (e.g., OpenSSL 3, nftables by default, etc.). Chef 17’s embedded components (OpenSSL 1.1, Ruby 3.0) may not leverage all new kernel features but should function. Watch for any minor issues due to newer libraries (e.g., if a compiled extension in Chef needed an update for newer glibc or OpenSSL, which Chef 18 addressed). RHEL9 also removed some legacy utilities; Chef itself shouldn’t be affected, but your recipes should avoid deprecated OS commands.

Key takeaways for each OS: On RHEL 7, Chef 17 will continue to work well, but note RHEL7’s lifecycle nearing end-of-life. Chef 17 supports it fully, with improvements in reliability for YUM and systemd interactions. On RHEL 8, Chef 17 is a natural fit – it uses DNF properly and supports all new concepts (like modules and compliance scanning on a modern platform). On RHEL 9, you should ideally use Chef Infra Client 18 if possible for official support; if using Chef 17, be aware it was not primary tested for 9, so proceed with caution or community support. Also, ensure any RHEL 9 nodes are using a Chef 17 build that’s compatible (for instance, the Cinc project or similar might provide an open-source build if Progress did not).

Finally, differences in system components (like systemd version or default Python) don’t require special configuration in Chef – Chef abstracts those. Just ensure the system’s package manager is functional (YUM or DNF) and that you leverage Chef 17’s new resources to manage system specifics (like using alternatives for any alternative configs, or selinux_* resources available in later releases if needed for RHEL8/9 which often use SELinux in enforcing mode).

Conclusion

Upgrading from Chef Infra Client 16 to 17 on RHEL 7/8/9 brings many benefits: improved performance, new features (compliance phase, new resources), and support for newer platforms. However, it also introduces some breaking changes and deprecations that require planning – notably the move to Ruby 3 and the removal of knife from the client package. By reviewing the code-level changes and addressing the conceptual differences (unified mode, scheduling, etc.), you can mitigate upgrade issues.

Chef 17 modernizes the automation setup, especially for RHEL 8/9 environments, by seamlessly handling DNF, modules, and compliance auditing. Ensure to update your cookbooks for any deprecated usage (like allowlist vs whitelist) and take advantage of the new resources to simplify your configurations. Testing the upgrade in a staging environment for each RHEL version is prudent, as is reading the official Chef 17 release notes for any minor version-specific changes beyond those covered here. With proper preparation, the transition to Chef 17 should be smooth and yield a more capable and efficient infrastructure automation on RHEL platforms.
