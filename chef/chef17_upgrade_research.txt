Great, I’ll look into the differences between Chef Infra Client v16 and v17, focusing on key changes, deprecations, and compatibility issues. I’ll also identify the risks of upgrading without modifying cookbooks, the necessary updates to ensure compatibility of internal and wrapped community cookbooks, and any runtime or environment-level changes needed across Linux and Windows platforms.

I’ll get back to you with a structured report detailing everything.

# Comparison of Chef Infra Client v16 and v17

Chef Infra Client v17 (released in 2021) introduced significant updates and changes compared to v16. Below is a structured analysis covering new features and deprecations in v17, potential breaking changes when upgrading from v16, recommended cookbook updates for compatibility, and runtime environment considerations on Linux and Windows platforms.

## Key Differences and New Features in Chef Infra Client 17

**Compliance Phase:** Chef 17 introduced a built-in *Compliance Phase* that allows executing InSpec compliance audits as part of the chef-client run, replacing the need for the legacy **audit** cookbook ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Compliance%20Phase)). Compliance results can be viewed in Chef Automate, providing integrated infrastructure and compliance reporting out-of-the-box ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Chef%20Infra%20Client%27s%20new%20Compliance,during%20Chef%20Infra%20Client%20updates)). (Existing users of the audit cookbook can migrate by removing that cookbook and enabling this new phase – see Best Practices below.)

**Upgraded Language (Ruby 3.0):** Chef Infra Client 17 packages ship with **Ruby 3.0** embedded ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Ruby%203)). This upgrade improves performance and unlocks new Ruby language features for writing recipes and custom resources. It also means any custom Ruby code or gems used in cookbooks must be compatible with Ruby 3.0. (For example, some gems might need updates to support Ruby 3, as discussed later.) Additionally, Chef 17 added language improvements like lazy attribute evaluation in cookbooks (to better support wrapper cookbooks overriding attributes) and safer handling of custom resource default property values to avoid “frozen” errors ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,Defaults)).

**Chef Client Tooling Changes:** The **`knife`** command-line utility is no longer included in the Chef Client package as of v17 ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=For%20historical%20packaging%20reasons%20the,and%20smaller%20Chef%20Infra%20Client)). Knife has been moved to Chef Workstation (it ships as a separate gem), making the Chef Client install smaller and more secure on nodes. Operationally, this means you should use Chef Workstation for any knife commands (the chef-client on nodes is purely for client-run now). Also note that **Chef Infra Client as a Windows Service** is no longer supported in v17 – the ability to run chef-client as a service on Windows was removed due to reliability issues ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,A%20Service%20on%20Windows)). Instead, running Chef as a scheduled task is the recommended approach (see Breaking Changes below).

**New Resources and Improvements:** Chef 17 brings numerous new resources and enhancements to built-in resources, which can benefit cookbooks managing web servers and databases. Notable additions include:

- **Windows Patching and Security:** New resources for Windows updates and security were added. For example, `windows_update_settings` (for managing Windows Update/WSUS configuration) and `windows_defender`/`windows_defender_exclusion` (to manage Windows Defender settings) are introduced in v17 ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=Chef%20Infra%20Client%2017%20includes,resource%20for%20managing%20Windows%20Update)). There is also expanded support for Windows security policy via the `windows_security_policy` resource, improvements to Windows firewall rule management (allowing multiple IPs per rule), printer configuration (`windows_printer` and `windows_printer_port` updated), and certificate management (`windows_certificate` can now import/export certs, etc.) ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=o%20windows_update_settings%20resource%20for%20managing,updates%20to%20windows_printer%20and%20windows_printer_port)) ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=windows_firewall_rule%20o%20Improved%20performance%20in,Virtuozzo%2C%20and%20Alibaba%20Cloud%20Linux)). These additions streamline managing Windows servers in cookbooks (e.g. configuring patching or AV settings without external scripts).

- **Cloud/Platform Support:** Chef 17 expanded support for new platforms and architectures. It added native support for Apple M1 (macOS 11/12 on ARM) and improved detection or packages for new Linux distributions (e.g. AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux as replacements for CentOS, plus detection for Sangoma, Virtuozzo, Alibaba Cloud Linux) ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Expanded%20platform%20support%20o,support%20on%20RHEL%2FCentOS%20PPC%20architectures)). ARM architecture support was improved (for example, better ARM CPU detection and official builds for ARM in some cases). There were also enhancements for Linux like FIPS mode support on Ubuntu and certain RHEL variants ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=o%20macOS%2012%20and%20macOS,support%20on%20RHEL%2FCentOS%20PPC%20architectures)). These changes mean a broader range of systems (including newer cloud instances and ARM64 servers) can be managed by Chef 17 with official support.

- **Chef Habitat and Compliance Integration:** For organizations using Chef Habitat or doing compliance automation, Chef 17 added resources and helpers. There are six new resources for installing and managing Chef Habitat packages/services via Chef Infra ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20New%20resources%20o%20New,Update%20settings%20including%20WSUS%20settings)). Additionally, new resources for defining InSpec waivers and inputs in recipes were introduced (tying into the Compliance Phase). Chef 17’s **“Full Stack Visibility”** refers to this tighter integration between infra and compliance, making it easier to ensure nodes meet security benchmarks as well as configuration state.

- **User Experience and Performance:** Chef Infra 17 includes numerous under-the-hood improvements. Logging at the debug level was enriched for many resources to aid troubleshooting ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=)). The `execute` resource gained a `login` property to simulate a login shell for command executions ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=The%20,defined%20in%20the%20user%27s%20shell)). The `hostname` resource added an `fqdn` property to set the system’s FQDN ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=)). Critical resources for services were optimized – for example, `systemd_unit` now checks unit status in a single shell-out (much faster when managing many units) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=)), and `apt_package` can properly handle package downgrades (with stricter version checking) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=)). These improvements can benefit cookbooks for web servers/DBs by speeding up run times and providing more reliable behavior (e.g. apt package version enforcement).

**Deprecations in v17:** A few legacy items were officially deprecated or removed in Chef 17:

- Chef 17 is the first release where *Chef Infra Client 15 and older* became End-of-Life (as Chef follows a support window of the latest two major versions) ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=Chef%20provides%20support%2C%20bug%20fixes%2C,Chef%20Infra%20Client%2015%20is)). Chef Infra Client 16 remains supported alongside 17, but older versions are no longer maintained.

- As mentioned, the *Windows Chef-Client Service* capability was removed (deprecated via warnings in earlier versions and now gone in v17) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,A%20Service%20on%20Windows)). Similarly, the **audit cookbook** is effectively deprecated by the new Compliance Phase (users are encouraged to migrate as noted above).

- Terminology changes: Attributes or config settings using “**whitelist/blacklist**” nomenclature (deprecated in Chef 16.3) should be replaced with **“allowlist/blocklist”**, as the old terms are slated for removal ([March 23 Catalog Update #20240323 - Easy2Patch | Easy2Patch](https://blog.easy2patch.com/catalog-posts-2024/march-23-catalog-update-20240323-easy2patch#:~:text=5.22.40.%20%28,replaced%20with%20blocklist%20and%20allowlist)). (Chef 17 still honors the old terms but will log deprecation warnings; Chef 18+ fully removes them ([March 23 Catalog Update #20240323 - Easy2Patch | Easy2Patch](https://blog.easy2patch.com/catalog-posts-2024/march-23-catalog-update-20240323-easy2patch#:~:text=5.22.40.%20%28,with%20blocklist%20and%20allowlist%20attributes)).)

- Minor deprecations: The `gem` package resource (for installing gems to system Ruby) now assumes Ruby 1.9+ (dropping any compat for ancient Ruby 1.8) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,9)). Some legacy Ohai data was retired – e.g., on Unix platforms the old `node['filesystem2']` attribute (from a long-past migration) was removed in favor of `node['filesystem']` ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,on%20AIX%2FSolaris%2FFreeBSD)). On Windows, `node['filesystem']` data format was updated to the new unified structure (matching `filesystem2`), preparing to drop `filesystem2` entirely in the next major release ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,Format%20on%20Windows)). Also, Ohai stopped detecting very old distros like Antergos and Pidora (both EOL) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,Pidora%20Detection)). These changes are unlikely to affect most modern web or DB cookbooks, except in very niche cases (e.g. if a cookbook explicitly parsed those ohai attributes or was running on those old OS distributions).

## Potential Issues and Breaking Changes Upgrading from v16 to v17

Upgrading from Chef Infra Client 16 to 17 is generally straightforward, but there are several potential issues or breaking changes to watch for if you **do not modify any cookbooks** during the upgrade:

- **Chef-Client on Windows (Service vs Task):** If your infrastructure was running `chef-client` as a Windows service (possibly set up via the older **chef-client** cookbook or custom means), Chef 17 will no longer manage or run under that service. The built-in service manager for Chef Client was removed in v17 ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,A%20Service%20on%20Windows)). This means after upgrading, Chef will not continue running on schedule unless you switch to using a scheduled task. Nodes that aren’t updated to use the scheduled task could stop applying configurations. In short, plan to migrate the service to a scheduled task (see best practices below) to avoid interruption.

- **Ruby 3.0 Compatibility (Gem and Library Issues):** Because Chef 17 runs on Ruby 3.0, any cookbook that installs additional gems or uses Ruby libraries needs scrutiny. In most cases things work transparently, but if a cookbook uses `chef_gem` or `gem_package` to install a gem that hasn’t been updated for Ruby 3, the installation or functionality might break. For example, users found that certain Azure SDK gems failed under Chef 17 until those gems were updated for Ruby 3 ([Development Tools no longer included in Chef Infra Client 17 · Issue #11476 · chef/chef · GitHub](https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/11476#:~:text=rhys96%20%20%20commented%20,76)). If you have cookbooks for web or DB servers that rely on third-party Ruby gems (for databases, cloud APIs, etc.), test those components – you may need to upgrade the gem versions or find alternatives if they’re not Ruby 3 compatible. (Note: The chef-client installer itself still includes the C library bindings it did in v16, so native gem installs *can* work – but if a gem requires compilation and no pre-built binary for Ruby 3, you’ll need developer tools on the node or an updated gem release.)

- **Removal of Knife from Nodes:** Chef 17 no longer includes the `knife` binary in the client install ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=For%20historical%20packaging%20reasons%20the,and%20smaller%20Chef%20Infra%20Client)). In most cases, this is not an issue for node cookbooks (since `knife` is typically used from workstations, not within recipes). However, if any automation scripts or cookbook recipes were oddly invoking `knife` commands locally on the node (an anti-pattern, but possible), those will fail after upgrade. Ensure that any infrastructure automation using Knife is done from Chef Workstation, not from the chef-client on nodes.

- **Changes in Resource Behaviors:** While most recipes will continue to run as before, a few resource changes in v17 could surface issues:
  - The `apt_package` resource now raises an error on invalid or partial version strings (to properly support downgrades) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=)). If any cookbook was passing a version that doesn’t exactly match a package (or left it blank expecting latest), this could throw an error where v16 might have silently ignored it. Review any pinned package installs for correctness.
  - The overhaul of `windows_certificate` means it has new capabilities (import/export, etc.). It should be backward compatible, but if a cookbook was using workarounds for limitations of the old version, those may need adjustment. Similarly, `windows_firewall_rule` now supports arrays of IPs – if a cookbook was manually looping to create multiple rules, it could simplify logic (not a breaking issue, just an improvement).
  - Custom resources without `unified_mode` should still behave as in v16 (unified mode is **not** forced in Chef 17), so you won’t see a break in compile/converge behavior yet. However, Chef 17 did change how default property values in custom resources are handled (they are now duped internally to avoid freezing) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Chef%20Infra%20Client%27s%20handling%20of,fatal%20frozen%20value%20modification%20errors)). In the rare case that a cookbook relied on mutating a default property within a custom resource, the behavior might differ (but the new behavior is more correct and prevents errors). It’s wise to run your recipes in Chef 17 in a test environment to catch any such subtle differences.
  - Chef 17’s new Compliance Phase is **opt-in** (controlled by an attribute), so simply upgrading won’t suddenly start running compliance scans unless you enable it. Thus, leaving the audit cookbook in place with compliance phase off will continue to work as it did in v16 (though it’s deprecated). No immediate breakage will occur from the audit cookbook, but you won’t get the benefits of the new system until you switch.

- **Ohai Data and Plugin Changes:** Most Ohai plugin updates in Chef 17 won’t negatively impact common cookbooks, but be aware of a couple of edge cases:
  - On **AIX** (if applicable), the virtualization info data types changed (strings to integers) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=)) – if any recipe on AIX was parsing those attributes as strings, it would need updating. (Not likely relevant unless you manage AIX hosts for databases.)
  - The `node['filesystem']` data on Windows is now formatted differently (matching Linux). If a cookbook explicitly expected the old format on Windows, it may not find the data in the same structure. In practice, most cookbooks just use high-level constructs (like `filesystem2` which now mirrors `filesystem`), so this is low impact.
  - If you were relying on the community **ohai cookbook** to deploy custom Ohai plugins, note that it was deprecated around this time. Many cookbooks (e.g., the nginx cookbook) removed dependency on it by Chef 17 ([nginx Cookbook - Chef Supermarket](https://community.getchef.com/cookbooks/nginx/versions/12.2.12#:~:text=nginx%20Cookbook%20,3)). While this doesn’t “break” on its own, the ohai cookbook may not be keeping up with latest Chef releases. It’s recommended to use Chef Infra’s built-in `ohai_plugin` resource to manage custom plugins going forward (discussed below).

- **Operating System Support Gaps:** Upgrading without adjusting cookbooks won’t fix any OS compatibility problems. By design, Chef 17 dropped support for some older platforms:
  - If you have any nodes on **CentOS 8**, be aware that Chef 17 (after CentOS 8’s EOL) stopped shipping packages for it, favoring AlmaLinux 8 instead ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=CentOS%208)). A node still running CentOS 8 would not be able to upgrade to the latest Chef 17 releases (nor Chef 18) without switching to a supported RHEL8 clone (e.g. AlmaLinux or Rocky Linux). Similarly, Chef 17 does not build for 32-bit RHEL6 (only 64-bit) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,Support)).
  - On Windows, Chef 17 is only provided for 64-bit Windows. By the time of Chef 18, support for **Windows 8/8.1** and **any 32-bit Windows** was fully dropped ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=Windows%208)). If you have legacy 32-bit Windows servers or Windows 8.x client OS nodes running Chef 16, you will not find a Chef 17 upgrade for them. Those systems would need an OS upgrade (or remain on Chef 16, which is not ideal long-term).

In summary, most well-written cookbooks for web servers and databases should transition from 16 to 17 with minimal friction. The main breaking scenarios involve environment setup (Windows service vs task, OS compatibility) and external dependencies (gems or tools not ready for Ruby 3). Deprecation warnings may appear (for things like legacy attribute names or audit cookbook usage), but outright failures are mostly avoidable with the above considerations. Testing the upgrade in a staging environment is highly recommended to catch any unexpected issues.

## Cookbook Changes and Best Practices for v17 Compatibility

To ensure your internal cookbooks and wrapper community cookbooks work smoothly with Chef Infra Client 17, consider the following changes and best practices:

- **Update Community Cookbooks:** Incorporate the latest versions of any community cookbooks you wrap or use. Many community cookbooks released around the Chef 17 timeframe included fixes for compatibility. For example, the nginx cookbook v12.0 added `unified_mode true` to its custom resources (for Chef 17 compatibility) and removed its dependency on the deprecated ohai cookbook ([nginx Cookbook - Chef Supermarket](https://community.getchef.com/cookbooks/nginx/versions/12.2.12#:~:text=nginx%20Cookbook%20,3)). Using updated cookbooks means they have already handled deprecations and tested against Chef 17. Look for release notes of cookbooks for mentions of Chef 17 support and apply those updates in your wrappers.

- **Enable Unified Mode in Custom Resources:** While not strictly required in Chef 17, it is a best practice to add `unified_mode true` to your custom resources now. Unified Mode (introduced in v16) makes resource execution single-phased and will become the default in Chef 18+ ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=Unified%20mode%20is%20now%20enabled,12692)). By enabling it in your internal cookbooks, you ensure your resources behave consistently and are future-proof. This avoids surprises when you eventually move beyond v17. Test your custom resources with unified mode on under Chef 17 to verify they function the same (most will, unless they relied on peculiar compile-phase logic).

- **Run Cookstyle and Address Deprecations:** It’s highly recommended to run the latest **Cookstyle** (Chef’s RuboCop-based linter) on your cookbooks. Chef 17’s tooling introduced new Cookstyle “cops” that can automatically detect and correct many deprecated patterns in cookbooks ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=Linux%202%20o%20Improvements%20to,better%20processes%20to%20avoid%20potentially)). For instance, Cookstyle can rename any uses of `node['something_whitelist']` to `...['something_allowlist']`, update legacy Chef syntax, and flag any Chef 17 incompatibilities. By cleaning up your cookbook code with these tools, you’ll eliminate deprecation warnings and ensure compatibility. Short, focused changes (e.g., replacing deprecated attribute names, removing legacy cookbook dependencies, etc.) can usually be applied automatically by Cookstyle’s autocorrect feature ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=Linux%202%20o%20Improvements%20to,better%20processes%20to%20avoid%20potentially)).

- **Migrate Off the Audit Cookbook:** If your cookbooks include the `audit` cookbook (for compliance scans), migrate to Chef 17’s integrated Compliance Phase. This involves removing `audit` from run lists and setting `node['audit']['compliance_phase'] = true` in an attribute or recipe so that Chef’s built-in phase is activated ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Existing%20audit%20cookbook%20users%20can,compliance_phase%27%5D%60%20attribute%20to%20%60true)). All the same configuration (profiles, reports, etc.) can be done via attributes as before, but now you won’t need to manage an external cookbook for it. This reduces technical debt and ensures you’re using the officially supported method for compliance going forward ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Compliance%20Phase)). Additionally, remove any old InSpec or audit cookbook pinning in your environment.

- **Adapt to Windows Chef-Client Task:** For any cookbooks responsible for managing the Chef run schedule on Windows nodes, switch to using the **`chef_client_scheduled_task`** resource (built into Chef 16+). If you previously used the `chef-client::task` or `::service` recipes, update your wrapper to use the resource that ships with Chef. The resource allows you to set up a scheduled task for Chef runs easily, and it was the intended replacement for the service ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Chef%20Infra%20Client%20can%20be,Client%20run%20to%20migrate%20systems)). For example, you can add a recipe in your base cookbook that ensures a scheduled task is created (and if you like, also stops/disables any lingering Chef service). This aligns with Chef 17’s removal of the service and follows the officially recommended approach ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=entirely%20in%20October%20of%202017)) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Chef%20Infra%20Client%20can%20be,Client%20run%20to%20migrate%20systems)). 

- **Verify Gems and External Dependencies:** Review any **`chef_gem`** or custom Ruby code in your cookbooks. Ensure that gems you install are up-to-date. If a gem (e.g., a database driver or cloud SDK) hasn’t published a Ruby 3-compatible version, try to find an updated fork or consider alternate solutions. In one case, a user had to replace an Azure SDK gem by using in-built Ruby libraries until an updated gem was available ([Development Tools no longer included in Chef Infra Client 17 · Issue #11476 · chef/chef · GitHub](https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/11476#:~:text=rhys96%20%20%20commented%20,76)). It’s better to catch these in testing rather than during production chef-client runs. Where possible, constrain gem versions in metadata or recipes to ones you’ve verified on Chef 17.

- **Update Ohai Plugin Usage:** If you have internal custom Ohai plugins (for example, gathering custom system info for your web/database nodes), stop using the old **ohai cookbook** method of dropping files into `/etc/chef/ohai_plugins`. Chef Infra Client has a built-in `ohai_plugin` resource that you can use in a recipe to install and enable a plugin. This approach is more in line with Chef 17+ and avoids relying on an external cookbook that may be unmaintained. Also, audit your cookbooks for any direct references to now-changed Ohai data (such as the Windows filesystem data structure or the removed legacy attributes). Update those references if needed – for instance, use `node['filesystem']` on Windows instead of `node['filesystem2']`, since the former now contains the unified info in v17 ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,Format%20on%20Windows)).

- **Test Cookbooks on Chef 17 in Isolation:** Utilize Test Kitchen or a staging chef-server environment to run your cookbooks with Chef 17 before rolling out widely. Chef 17 put a focus on Test Driven Development for cookbooks, with improvements to Test Kitchen and Docker-based testing environments (e.g., the **dokken** driver for Kitchen) ([](https://www.chef.io/docs/cheflibraries/data-sheets/chef-infra-client-17_product-guide.pdf#:~:text=Chef%20Infra%20Client%2017%20Key,TDD%29%20%E2%80%A2%20Embedded%20profiles)). Leverage those tools to simulate different OS platforms (Linux/Windows) and ensure your recipes converge without errors on Chef 17. This is especially important for critical infrastructure like web servers and databases – you want to confirm that things like service resources, package installs, file templates, etc., all still apply correctly under the new client.

Following these practices will make your cookbooks **Chef 17-ready**. In many cases, well-maintained community cookbooks have already implemented these changes, so updating to their latest versions and adjusting your wrappers accordingly yields a smooth transition.

## Runtime Environment Changes and Prerequisites for Chef 17

When upgrading to Chef Infra Client 17, you should also account for the runtime environment requirements on your nodes. This ensures that both Linux and Windows systems are prepared to support the new client:

- **Supported Operating Systems (Linux):** Chef 17 targets a slightly different set of OS releases than Chef 16 did. Notably, **CentOS 8 is no longer supported** (CentOS 8 went EOL in Dec 2021, and Chef stopped producing packages for it in favor of AlmaLinux 8) ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=CentOS%208)). If your web or database servers run on CentOS 8, plan to migrate them to a supported RHEL-compatible distro (e.g., AlmaLinux or Rocky Linux 8) before upgrading the Chef client. RHEL 7, RHEL 8, Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 (and later 22.04 in newer 17.x releases) are fully supported. Older Linux versions like RHEL/CentOS 6 are **only supported in limited fashion**: Chef 17 did **not** build packages for 32-bit RHEL6 at all, and support for 64-bit RHEL6 was extended only through the Chef 17 lifecycle as an exception ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=,Support)). Thus, any remaining RHEL6 systems (e.g., old database servers) should be on 64-bit and should be scheduled for OS upgrade soon (Chef 18+ drops RHEL6 entirely). Ensure that your nodes meet the minimum OS requirements listed in Chef’s documentation (which by Chef 17 includes most modern enterprise Linux, but drops very old releases).

- **Supported Operating Systems (Windows):** Chef Infra Client 17 supports modern Windows platforms (Server 2012 R2, 2016, 2019, 2022, and equivalent Windows 10/11 for workstations). It no longer offers builds for outdated or niche Windows versions. In particular, Chef 17/18 do **not** support Windows 8/8.1 or any 32-bit Windows editions ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=Windows%208)). If your environment includes older 32-bit Windows Server installations or Windows 8.x, those nodes cannot be upgraded to Chef 17. Plan to upgrade the OS (or retire those hosts) to use Chef 17. Also, Chef 17 was built on the Universal C Runtime for Windows and a new MSYS2-based toolchain ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=%2A%20libxslt%201.1.14%20,5.18.14%20%28%2313144)) – these are packaged with the installer, but it implies that Windows nodes should ideally be fully updated (Windows updates applied) to avoid any runtime library issues. Practically, if you’re on a supported Windows version, the Chef 17 installer will handle its dependencies automatically.

- **Resource Scheduling on Windows:** As noted, Chef 17 removed the service-mode operation on Windows. This means your Windows nodes should have an alternative way to run chef-client periodically. The environment prerequisite here is to ensure the **Scheduled Task** is in place. From an ops standpoint, before or immediately after upgrading the client, use the `chef_client_scheduled_task` resource (or manually create a scheduled task via GPO/script) so that Chef runs at the desired interval. This is less a software prerequisite and more a configuration prerequisite – but it’s critical for maintaining continuous configuration management on Windows hosts.

- **Memory/Performance Considerations:** Chef Infra Client 17’s upgrade to Ruby 3 and other component updates (e.g., a newer OpenSSL, updated libs) might have a slight impact on node resource usage. Ruby 3.0 is generally more efficient, so most users won’t notice any higher CPU or memory usage (in fact, in some cases it may improve). However, it’s wise to verify that your nodes (especially if they are very constrained in memory) have enough headroom. For example, running a large compliance profile in the new Compliance Phase plus a heavy convergance on a small VM could increase memory usage. In most web/database server contexts (which tend to have ample resources), this won’t be an issue.

- **Network and Server Compatibility:** Chef 17 clients remain compatible with Chef Infra Server 12 and 13, but for best results use a recent Chef Infra Server (or Hosted Chef) version. No special server-side upgrade is required when moving clients from 16 to 17, although new features like compliance phase reporting require Chef Automate (for viewing results) to be updated to a version that knows about compliance data. Ensure your Chef Server and Automate are updated to handle the data Chef 17 sends (Chef Automate 2 with latest updates will support this). This isn’t a client prerequisite per se, but part of the ecosystem readiness.

- **Dependency on Chef Workstation (for Knife/Bootstrap):** Since Chef 17 clients no longer include Knife, make sure your workflow for bootstrapping new nodes or managing nodes is updated. You should have Chef Workstation (latest version) available for performing bootstrap operations (`knife bootstrap` or the newer `chef bootstrap`). Chef 17 expects that you use external tools for these tasks. This means administrators’ laptops or the automation pipeline should be using Workstation 21.x or 22.x which is fully compatible with Chef 17 nodes.

- **Other Platform Notes:** Chef 17 improved support for alternative init systems and containerized environments. For instance, it recognizes if it’s running under **Podman** containers (setting appropriate ohai data) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=Ohai)) ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=For%20Chef%20Infra%20Client%20within,following%20attributes%20will%20be%20set)). If you plan to run chef-client in a container (for ephemeral infrastructure or testing), Chef 17 can handle that better. It also introduced an Ohai plugin for Habitat, so if your apps are managed by Chef Habitat, the Chef 17 client will auto-discover Habitat services on the node ([Chef Infra Client 17.0 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-17-0-released/19825#:~:text=)). These aren’t prerequisites but rather environment enhancements to be aware of – Chef 17 is more “container aware” and “Habitat aware” than v16.

In summary, ensure all nodes are running on Chef-supported OS versions (upgrade OS if needed before the Chef client upgrade), especially for any legacy Linux or Windows systems. Adjust the node configuration (scheduled tasks on Windows, etc.) to align with Chef 17’s operation. Most modern Linux and Windows setups will meet Chef 17’s requirements with no issues, but doing this housekeeping upfront will prevent surprises. With the environment prepared and the cookbooks updated as per the best practices, your upgrade from Chef Infra Client 16 to 17 should be successful, bringing in the new features and improvements while maintaining stability ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=CentOS%208)) ([Chef Infra Client 18.0.169 Released! - Chef Release Announcements - Chef Questions](https://discourse.chef.io/t/chef-infra-client-18-0-169-released/21570#:~:text=Windows%208)).
